This is a GitHub Actions workflow script that is triggered by a push to the repository or manually by the workflow_dispatch event. It has one job called "workflow-analysis" that runs on an Ubuntu operating system virtual machine.

The job has [several steps](https://github.com/cms-dpoa/cat-hackathon/actions/runs/4696773739/jobs/8327157486), which are:

1.  **Free some disk space:** This step uses a community action called "AdityaGarg8/remove-unwanted-software" to remove some unnecessary software packages, such as Android, .NET, and Haskell, to free up disk space on the virtual machine.
    
2.  **Checkout code:** This step uses the official "actions/checkout" action to checkout the code from the repository into the virtual machine.
    
3.  **Prepare directories:** This step creates three directories, "outputs/coffea", "outputs/rdf", and "outputs/production", using the "mkdir -p" command. It also echoes the result of the "ls -l" command to the console.
    
4.  **Run production:** This step runs a Docker container using the "docker run" command with a specific Docker image "gitlab-registry.cern.ch/cms-cloud/cmssw-docker/cmssw_10_6_30-slc7_amd64_gcc700". The container executes a script called "pf_production.sh" located in the "production/pfnano" directory of the repository. It then copies the resulting "output.root" file to the "outputs/production" directory.
    
The `pf_production.sh` is a bash script used to perform a particle flow analysis in the production of NanoAOD (NANO) format for the CMS experiment at CERN. It takes three parameters:

-   `$1`: The first parameter specifies who is running the code (outside GitHub actions, it can be any other string or can be omitted). If it is "github," the script will be run inside a GitHub action environment.
-   `$2`: The second parameter specifies the number of events to process. If not specified, it will process 20 events.
-   `$3`: The third parameter specifies the input file to process. If not specified, it will use a default file from the EOS public CERN storage.

The script first checks if it is running inside a GitHub action environment. If it is, it changes the ownership of the /mnt/vol directory to the current user, and then runs a CMS software stack and installs some additional packages for the particle flow analysis.

After the installation, the script runs the `cmsDriver.py` command to generate a NanoAOD file from the input file. It then checks if it is running inside a GitHub action environment. If it is, it copies the output file to the /mnt/vol directory so that it can be accessed by other steps in the GitHub action.

Finally, the script emulates creating a root file by copying the NanoAOD file to a new file with a `.root` extension.
    
5.  **Download Coffea-Base image:** This step uses the "docker pull" command to download a Docker image called "coffeateam/coffea-base".
    
6.  **Run Coffea-Base container:** This step runs a Docker container using the "docker run" command with the "coffeateam/coffea-base" image. The container executes a Python script called "coffea_plot.py" located in the "analysis/coffea" directory of the repository. It then moves the resulting ".png" files and "PF_n.txt" file to the "outputs/coffea" directory.
    
7.  **Download ROOT-Base image:** This step uses the "docker pull" command to download a Docker image called "rootproject/root".
    
8.  **Run ROOT-Base container:** This step runs a Docker container using the "docker run" command with the "rootproject/root" image. The container executes a Python script called "rdf_plot.py" located in the "analysis/rdataframe" directory of the repository. It then moves the resulting ".png" files to the "outputs/rdf" directory.
    
9.  **Upload results:** This step uses the official "actions/upload-artifact" action to upload the "outputs/" directory as an artifact named "Analysis Results". This will allow the results of the workflow to be accessed by other workflows or jobs later in the pipeline.

You can see the specific details of this run [in this GitHub action](https://github.com/cms-dpoa/cat-hackathon/actions/runs/4696773739).

The input file used in the `pf_production.sh` script, which is one of the main parts of this workflow, is a CMS Open Data file located on the EOS CERN storage system. The `cmsDriver.py` command in the `pf_production.sh` script is used to process the input file and produce a NanoAOD output file that is also in the open data format. Furthermore, the PhysicsTools/PFNano repository used in this workflow is designed specifically for reading and processing NanoAOD files. Overall, this workflow demonstrates how open data from CMS can be used to test and validate analysis workflows.
